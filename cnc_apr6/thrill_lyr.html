      <p class='verse'>
        It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking<br>
        In the dark<br>
        Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops<br>
        Your heart<br>
        You try to scream, but terror takes the sound before<br>
        You make it<br>
        You start to freeze as horror looks you right between<br>
        The eyes<br>
        You're paralyzed
      </p>
      <p class='verse'>
        'Cause this is thriller, thriller night<br>
        And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to<br>
        Strike<br>
        You know it's thriller, thriller night<br>
        You're fighting for your life inside a killer<br>
        Thriller tonight
      </p>
      <p class='verse'>
        You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere<br>
        Left to run<br>
        You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see<br>
        The sun<br>
        You close your eyes and hope that this is just<br>
        Imagination<br>
        But all the while you hear the creature creepin' up<br>
        Behind<br>
        You're out of time
      </p>
      <p class='verse'>
        'Cause this is thriller, thriller night<br>
        There ain't no second chance against the thing with<br>
        Forty eyes<br>
        You know it's thriller, thriller night<br>
        You're fighting for your life inside a killer<br>
        Thriller tonight
      </p>
      <p class='verse'>
        Night creatures call<br>
        And the dead start to walk in their masquerade<br>
        There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time<br>
        (They're open wide)<br>
        This is the end of your life
      </p>
      <p class='verse'>
        They're out to get you; there's demons closing in on<br>
        Every side<br>
        They will possess you unless you change the number on<br>
        Your dial<br>
        Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close<br>
        Together<br>
        All through the night I'll save you from the terrors on<br>
        The screen<br>
        I'll make you see
      </p>
      <p class='verse'>
        That it's a thriller, thriller night<br>
        'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost<br>
        Would ever dare try<br>
        Girl, this is thriller, thriller night<br>
        So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller<br>
        Chiller<br>
        Thriller here tonight
      </p>
      <p class='verse'>
        That it's a thriller, thriller night<br>
        'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost<br>
        Would ever dare try<br>
        Girl, this is thriller, thriller night<br>
        So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller
      </p>
      <p class='verse'>
        Darkness falls across the land<br>
        The midnight hour is close at hand<br>
        Creatures crawl in search of blood<br>
        To terrorize y'awl's neighborhood<br>
        And whosoever shall be found<br>
        Without the soul for getting down<br>
        Must stand and face the hounds of hell<br>
        And rot inside a corpse's shell
      </p>
      <p class='verse'>
        The foulest stench is in the air<br>
        The funk of forty thousand years<br>
        And grizzly ghouls from every tomb<br>
        Are closing in to seal your doom<br>
        And though you fight to stay alive<br>
        Your body starts to shiver<br>
        For no mere mortal can resist<br>
        The evil of the thriller
      </p>
